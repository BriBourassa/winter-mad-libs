# Winter Mad Libs
A Mad Lib is a word game where players can choose words at random to create their own stories. Learn more about the history of Mad Libs [here](https://www.madlibs.com/history/)!

## Instructions
- Clone down this repo 
- Plan out and write CSS to design the application. No comps are provided, be as creative as you want! The HTML has been written for you, but it is just a start. Add HTML elements, classes, etc. or change the structure around if needed.  
- Create the following functionality: 

_As a user, I should be able to type a word into each text box. If I have filled out all boxes, and clicked the button, I should see:_
  - _the text boxes disappear._
  - _a story appear with my words filled in the correct places._

### Considerations
- How will you handle a user submitting before they have filled out the text boxes?
